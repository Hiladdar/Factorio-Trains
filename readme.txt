I have had to break the zip file up becouse github has a 25mb limit per file.  To reassemble the distributable package:

1.  Download the following zip files:

	Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_no_fluid_wagon.zip
	Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_fluid_wagon.zip
	Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_hr_fluid_wagon1.zip
	Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_hr_fluid_wagon2.zip

2. Rename Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_no_fluid_wagon.zip to Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3.zip.

3.  Open the Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3.zip. and copy the folder fluid_wagon from Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3_fluid_wagon.zip to the folder ./Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3/grahics/entity.

4.  Repeat the same process for the high resolution fluid wagons files, dropping the high resolution graphic files into Hiladdar_Trains_0.16.3/graphics/entity/fluid-wagon.
